### System design is essential for building scalable, reliable, and maintainable software systems. This repository is created to cover the fundamental building blocks of system design—such as tools, services, and architectural components—and to explain their underlying details and practical applications.

### Alongside foundational concepts and building blocks, we will solve real-world system design problems by assembling these components into practical architectures.

### We will deep dive into different tools and selection strategies tailored to real-world use cases for core aspect like:
- Database Strategy
- Caching
- Scaling
- Ressilience
- Security
- Availability
- Performance
